## Setup

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dakshesh14/anukool.git
cd anukool
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add the environment variables and populate them

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

By default, the app will use openai's model. If you wish to change that to llama-2, change the `MODEL_NAME` variable in `.env` file to `llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin`.

> Note: if you change the model to something other than openai's, you will have to download the model and place it in `models` folder. To download the model, run the following command(taking 7b model as an example):

```bash
cd models
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin?download=true

```

or in powershell ðŸ‘‡

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin?download=true" -OutFile "models\llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin" # in powershell
```

Additionally, you will have to populate the `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file. To get the token, go to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/settings/token) and copy the token.

5. Add your pdf in `docs` folder.

6. Run the script

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

7. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.
